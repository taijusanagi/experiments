    "## ðŸ§© Introduction to Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the model learns from data **without any labels**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no answers provided â€” just raw input data.  \n",
    "The goal is to discover **patterns**, **structures**, or **groupings** hidden inside the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. How Is It Different from Supervised Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the model is trained with **input-output pairs**.  \n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the model only sees the **inputs** and has to figure things out on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no teacher.  \n",
    "No right or wrong labels.  \n",
    "The model tries to understand the data just by looking at how the examples are distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What Can Unsupervised Learning Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### â€¢ Clustering\n",
    "Group similar data points together based on their features.  \n",
    "You donâ€™t tell it what the groups are â€” it just finds them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Grouping customers with similar shopping habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### â€¢ Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "Compress high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions while keeping as much information as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Visualizing complex data like images or documents in 2D.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### â€¢ Anomaly Detection\n",
    "Find rare or unusual points that donâ€™t fit the general pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Detecting fraudulent transactions or system errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### â€¢ Topic Modeling\n",
    "Automatically discover topics inside a collection of text documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Summarizing thousands of news articles by common themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Why Use Unsupervised Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might use unsupervised learning when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You **donâ€™t have labels** or annotated data  \n",
    "- You want to **explore the structure** of your dataset  \n",
    "- You want to **compress**, **clean**, or **organize** your data  \n",
    "- You want to find **hidden patterns** that humans might not notice\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Common Unsupervised Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular unsupervised learning methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- K-Means Clustering  \n",
    "- Hierarchical Clustering  \n",
    "- DBSCAN  \n",
    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  \n",
    "- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)  \n",
    "- t-SNE and UMAP  \n",
    "- Topic Modeling (e.g. LDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these techniques focuses on a different type of pattern or structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning helps you find structure in unlabeled data.  \n",
    "Itâ€™s often used for exploration, discovery, visualization, and pattern detection."
