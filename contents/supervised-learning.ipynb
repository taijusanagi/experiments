    "## üß† Introduction to Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning** is one of the main branches of machine learning.  \n",
    "It refers to training a model using data where the correct answers (called **labels**) are already known.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What Does ‚ÄúSupervised‚Äù Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs called **supervised** because the model learns from **examples with answers**.  \n",
    "Each training example includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **input** (often called $x$), like a list of features  \n",
    "- A known **output** or **label** (called $y$), like a category or number\n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns a rule to map inputs to outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x \\rightarrow y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions on **unseen data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Two Types of Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification\n",
    "The goal is to predict a **category**.  \n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "- Spam or not spam  \n",
    "- Dog or cat  \n",
    "- Will the customer buy or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression\n",
    "The goal is to predict a **continuous number**.  \n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "- Price of a house  \n",
    "- Temperature tomorrow  \n",
    "- Amount of rainfall\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Example (No Table)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to predict house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have input features like:\n",
    "- The size of the house  \n",
    "- The number of bedrooms  \n",
    "- The location\n",
    "\n",
    "And for each house, you already know its price.  \n",
    "The model learns to predict price based on those features.  \n",
    "This is a **regression** problem, because the output is a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. How Supervised Learning Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split the dataset** into a training set and a test set  \n",
    "2. **Train the model** on the training set  \n",
    "3. **Evaluate the model** on the test set\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluation, we use metrics like:\n",
    "- **Accuracy** for classification  \n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a model that performs well on **new, unseen data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Examples of Supervised Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many supervised learning algorithms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression  \n",
    "- Logistic Regression  \n",
    "- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  \n",
    "- Decision Trees  \n",
    "- Naive Bayes  \n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  \n",
    "- Random Forests  \n",
    "- Boosting methods (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these models has strengths and weaknesses depending on the dataset and the problem type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is used when you have **input‚Äìoutput pairs** and want the model to **learn from labeled data**.  \n",
    "It includes both **classification** (predicting categories) and **regression** (predicting numbers).  \n",
    "In the next sections, we‚Äôll explore common supervised models, starting with **Linear Regression**.\n"
