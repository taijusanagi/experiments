    "## ðŸš¨ Introduction to Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection is about finding **things that donâ€™t belong**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These could be:\n",
    "- A fraudulent credit card transaction\n",
    "- A faulty machine sensor reading\n",
    "- An unusual customer behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to **identify rare, unusual patterns** that are different from the normal data â€” without necessarily having labels for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What Is an Anomaly?\n",
    "\n",
    "An anomaly (or outlier) is a data point that is **significantly different** from the rest of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three common types:\n",
    "- **Point anomalies** â€” a single abnormal value (e.g. a 10,000 dollar charge when most are under 100 dollars)\n",
    "- **Contextual anomalies** â€” normal in one context, strange in another (e.g. 40Â°C is normal in summer, not in winter)\n",
    "- **Collective anomalies** â€” a group of points is strange together (e.g. multiple failed logins in a row)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why Use Unsupervised Methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "In most real-world cases:\n",
    "- We **donâ€™t have labels** saying which data points are normal vs. abnormal\n",
    "- Anomalies are **rare**, making supervised training difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "So we often use **unsupervised algorithms** to find anomalies **based on the structure of the data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Learn what normal looks like. Then flag anything thatâ€™s far from it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Common unsupervised strategies include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### â€¢ Distance-based\n",
    "- Anomalies are **far from the center or neighbors**\n",
    "- Example: **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**, **Isolation Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### â€¢ Density-based\n",
    "- Anomalies live in **low-density regions**\n",
    "- Example: **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**, **DBSCAN**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### â€¢ Model-based\n",
    "- Fit a model to the data (e.g. PCA, Gaussian) and flag points that donâ€™t fit\n",
    "- Example: **One-Class SVM**, **Autoencoders**, **Elliptic Envelope**"
