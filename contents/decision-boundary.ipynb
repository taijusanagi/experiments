    "## ðŸ”€ Decision Boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification problems, a **decision boundary** is the surface (line in 2D) that separates different predicted classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Itâ€™s the point where the model is **undecided** â€” where the prediction flips from one class to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Why Do We Need It?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **regression**, we predict a continuous value.  \n",
    "In **classification**, we choose a category.\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify data, the model learns how to **divide the input space** into regions â€” one region per class.  \n",
    "The **borderline between regions** is the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Logistic Regression Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In binary classification, logistic regression computes a probability between 0 and 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\sigma(w \\cdot x + b)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We predict **class 1** when $\\hat{y} \\geq 0.5$, and **class 0** otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the **decision boundary** is where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = 0.5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad w \\cdot x + b = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) â€” the place where the model is exactly 50% confident.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Other Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Different models produce different kinds of boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear models** (like logistic regression): straight lines  \n",
    "- **k-NN**: irregular, local shapes  \n",
    "- **SVM with kernels**: smooth curves  \n",
    "- **Decision Trees**: axis-aligned splits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **decision boundary** separates one class from another.\n",
    "- It shows **where the model switches its prediction**.\n",
    "- Visualizing boundaries helps us understand how the model thinks â€” and whether it generalizes well."
